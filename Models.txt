Other pre-trained models can be selected with the -n flag. The list of pre-trained models is:

htdemucs: first version of Hybrid Transformer Demucs. Trained on MusDB + 800 songs. Default model.
htdemucs_ft: fine-tuned version of htdemucs, separation will take 4 times more time but might be a bit better. Same training set as htdemucs.
htdemucs_6s: 6 sources version of htdemucs, with piano and guitar being added as sources. Note that the piano source is not working great at the moment.
hdemucs_mmi: Hybrid Demucs v3, retrained on MusDB + 800 songs.
mdx: trained only on MusDB HQ, winning model on track A at the MDX challenge.
mdx_extra: trained with extra training data (including MusDB test set), ranked 2nd on the track B of the MDX challenge.
mdx_q, mdx_extra_q: quantized version of the previous models. Smaller download and storage but quality can be slightly worse.
SIG: where SIG is a single model from the model zoo.
The --two-stems=vocals option allows to separate vocals from the rest (e.g. karaoke mode). vocals can be changed into any source in the selected model. This will mix the files after separating the mix fully, so this won't be faster or use less memory.

The --shifts=SHIFTS performs multiple predictions with random shifts (a.k.a the shift trick) of the input and average them. This makes prediction SHIFTS times slower. Don't use it unless you have a GPU.

The --overlap option controls the amount of overlap between prediction windows. Default is 0.25 (i.e. 25%) which is probably fine. It can probably be reduced to 0.1 to improve a bit speed.

The -j flag allow to specify a number of parallel jobs (e.g. demucs -j 2 myfile.mp3). This will multiply by the same amount the RAM used so be careful!
